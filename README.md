`NOTE: Every resource used in this project are free to use for a certain threshold.`

## Things to keep in mind while testing 🤯.

- Supabase restricts user registration. So if, you are unable to Sign up as a new user, don't worry!
- I've provided the test Login credentials in the `.env.local.example` file. Use those to test out things!
